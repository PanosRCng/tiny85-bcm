  tiny85_bcm
 
 
 
 	- ATtiny85 Binary Code Modulation library
 
 
 	
 	- implements an 8bit BCM (256 possible levels) 
 	  with ~490Hz BCM frequency (~2ms period), and morhping step 2
 	  this means that the time it takes to go from level 0 to level 256 is ~1 second
 
 	  to modify use this formulas:

 	       F_TIMER = F_BCM * ( 2^bcm_bits -1 )
 
 	       (!) F_TIMER is the clock frequency after a possible prescalling 
 
 
 
 	- after included, 
 		- call bcm_init() and then enable interrupts
 		- in the main loop call bcm_morphing()
 
 
   	- developed (and tested) for ATtiny85 running 
 	  at 8 MHz from its internal oscillator
